           <h1 align="center">Weather Dashboard App</h1>

           <p>When the user enters the application they are asked to pick a state to find out the weather conditions currently, and the five day forecast. After deciding which 
           city they are presented with two different weather updates. The first is the current weather conditions, and the second is the five day forecast. The application also 
           saves the city that was input into an array of searched cities. Also the array of searched cities is able to be used by the user as a quick link to check the weather
           of an already selected city.<p>
